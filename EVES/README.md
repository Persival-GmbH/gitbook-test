# ENVITED Ecosystem Specifications (EVES)

The goal of the EVES project is to specify and provide high-quality documentation for developing, distributing and using standard-compliant co-simulation artifacts and data.
It is an initiative of the [asc(s e.V. Environment for Virtual Test Drive (ENVITED)](https://www.envited.market/).

The specifications itself are written as independent documents based on so-called "improvement protocols" typically used in de-centralized standardization efforts, e.g. in blockchain domains.
These individual specification documents stand for themselves but can inherit from one another be be linked to one another.

All EVES documents are written in Markdown format, sequentially numbered and stored in the [EVES folder](https://github.com/ASCS-eV/EVES/tree/main/EVES) as denoted in the menu on the left.
The process on how to write, submit or change specifications in defined in [EVES-1](eves-0001.md).
